# Box It

Box It is a Visual Studio Code extension that simplifies code sharing with AI models while respecting your privacy. It allows you to selectively add code snippets to a single file, optionally including folder structure information, making it easy to provide context to AI models without sharing your entire codebase.

## Features

- **Add to Box**: Select code and add it to a centralized file (default: `box.txt`)
- **Minification**: Optimize your code snippets with whitespace removal and comment stripping
- **Token Analytics**: Track and visualize your token usage and optimization metrics
- **Folder Structure**: Optionally include your project's folder structure in the box file
- **Privacy Control**: Choose what to share by selecting specific code snippets
- **Grouping**: Group code snippets from the same file under a single directory path section
- **Customizable**: Configure ignored folders, detailed folders, and more through VSCode settings
- **Throw the Box**: Easily delete the box file when you're done

## Usage

1. Select the code you want to add to the box
2. Right-click and choose one of the following options from the context menu:
   - "Add to box": Add the selected code to your box file
   - "Copy minified": Copy a minified version of the selected code to your clipboard
3. To view minification analytics, use the command "Show Minified Analytics"
4. To delete the box file, right-click in the editor (without selection) and choose "Throw the box"

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `box-it.folderStructure`: Enable or disable folder structure in Box.txt (default: "On")
* `box-it.ignoreFolders`: Comma-separated list of folders to ignore in the folder structure (default: ".git,node_modules,.vscode")
* `box-it.detailedFolders`: Comma-separated list of folders to show in detail, including subfolders (default: "")
* `box-it.GroupSections`: Group code snippets from the same file under a single directory path section (default: "On")
* `box-it.filename`: The filename for saving the text file (default: "box")
* `box-it.minify`: Enable minified format with [path:] syntax and removed whitespace (default: "Off")
* `box-it.removeComments`: Remove comments when minifying or adding to box (default: "Off")
* `box-it.showSizeDifference`: Show token count difference in notifications (default: "On")

## Minification Features

The extension includes several optimization features to help reduce token usage:

- **Whitespace Optimization**: Removes unnecessary whitespace while preserving code functionality
- **Comment Removal**: Optional removal of single-line and multi-line comments
- **Token Analytics**: Track the effectiveness of minification with detailed statistics
- **Smart Path Handling**: Compact file path representation in minified mode

## Analytics Dashboard

The extension provides a comprehensive analytics dashboard that shows:

- Total number of minifications performed
- Total original and minified token counts
- Total tokens saved through minification
- Average reduction percentage
- Detailed history of all minification operations
- Per-operation metrics and timestamps

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

- **Use at Your Own Risk**: The minification and comment removal features modify your code. While efforts are made to preserve functionality, there's no guarantee that the modified code will work exactly as the original.
- **Token Counting**: Token counts are approximations based on the GPT-4 tokenizer and may not match exactly with different AI models or API implementations.
- **Data Safety**: Always review the content of your box file before sharing it with AI models or others. The extension may inadvertently include sensitive information from comments or strings.
- **Backup Recommended**: Keep a backup of your original code. Don't rely on minified versions for source control or deployment.
- **Performance Impact**: The analytics feature stores data locally. Consider clearing analytics data periodically if storage becomes a concern.
- **Comment Removal**: The comment removal feature might affect code that relies on comments (like configuration files or documentation generators). Test thoroughly before using in production code.
